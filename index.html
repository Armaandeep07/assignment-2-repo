            <p>[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
                I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
                I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
                I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
                'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand
                
                [Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
                So then, when I'm finished
                I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
                I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
                Can't be everyone's favorite girl
                
                [Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
                So take aim and fire away
                I've never been so wide awake
                No, nobody but me can keep me safe
                And I'm on my way
                The blood moon is on the rise
                The fire burning in my eyes
                No, nobody but me can keep me safe
                And I'm on my way
                
                [Instrumental Break: Farruko]
                Blep, yah, yah
                Farru
                Yah-yah-yah-yah</p>
